# Elite Arsenal 1.0.1

## Major changes

Revamped structure to mitigate the difficulty spike in the early game, as well as provide more of a challenge in the late game:

- Introduce new "elite" versions of contracts which are denoted by a `(+)` in the mission title. These are the same as regular contracts but feature an opfor heavy with S-tier and X-tier elite mechs. They have a 50% higher C-bill payout and slightly more salvage picks.
- Elite contracts are now the only place where you can encounter S-tier mechs (X-tier can still be met in regular missions, or bought in shops).

Elite Forces is now enabled by default, while Elite Arsenal remains an opt-in mod for now.

## New content

- Add PPC capaci(ta)tor + and ++, for less heat and more damage. Existing mechs that use the PPC cap have been updated to use the improved variants (Annihilator X and S, Phoenix Hawk S, Warhammer X and S).
- Add Short-Range EW Suite as a new item, which gives a defense bonus at short range and melee damage reduction. This is intended to improve survivability for melee and brawler builds. Existing melee mechs have been updated to include this (Valiant X and S, Hatchetman X and S, Hatamoto-Chi S).
- Add Axman X and S.
- Add Gargoyle X and S.

## Other changes

- Fix ++clan ERSL stats and tooltip. +10 damage was an error, now gives +25% crit chance over the regular and + variant.
- Fix Bane S loadout to have ++HAG/20s.
- Fix stability values for several mechs.
- Fix internal structure values for several vehicles.
- Fix number of jumpjets for Hellhound X and S.
