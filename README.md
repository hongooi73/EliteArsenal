# Elite Arsenal

Elite Arsenal adds a clear progression path to [Expanded Arsenal](https://github.com/hongooi73/ExpandedArsenal). If you feel you've hit a ceiling with the base EA experience, enable Elite Arsenal to get the following:

- \+ and ++ variants of Expanded Arsenal weapons and gear.
- More than 250 elite variants of Expanded Arsenal mechs, which use this + and ++ equipment.
- Elite versions of all the regular contracts, for experienced players who have mastered the vanilla game.
- _Repeatable_ elite flashpoints for the ultimate endgame challenge.
- Extra lances and contract types, courtesy of the Mission Control mod.
- Tweaks to the AI that make it more aggressive and unpredictable, taken from the Better AI mod.

## New mechs

Elite Arsenal mechs come in two varieties, X- and S-tier:

- X-tier mechs have more effective builds compared to regular EA and vanilla mechs, including upgraded weapons and gear. They can be encountered in any mission.
- S-tier mechs have the best weapons and gear, engine double heatsinks, and can sink an extra +15 heat per turn; in addition, they are always piloted by ace mechwarriors from Elite Forces. They can only be found in elite contracts and flashpoints (see below).

It's entirely feasible for an S-tier mech to destroy an equivalent-tonnage vanilla mech in a couple of alpha strikes. On the flipside though, once you do kill one of these mechs, you get to loot all its goodies.

Some elite mechs (mostly Clan ones) also have special chassis buffs, matching those found on vanilla mechs like the Marauder or Warhammer:

- Annihilator (Optimized Capacitors)
- Commando (Close Quarters Combat Suite)
- Longbow (Missilery Suite)
- Marauder II (Lance Command Module)
- UrbanMech (Targeting Baffle, Ballistic Siege Compensators, Intercept System)
- Dire Wolf (Assault Enhancement Package: +10% damage, -10% heat)
- Hellbringer (Optimized Capacitors)
- Mad Cat (Lance Command Module)
- Mad Cat II (Lance Command Module)
- Mad Dog (Missilery Suite)
- Marauder IIC (Battle Computer, Advanced Command Module)
- Rifleman IIC (Rangefinder Suite)
- Shadowcat (Vectored Thrust Suite)
- Vapor Eagle (Intercept System)
- Warhammer IIC (Optimized Capacitors)
- Preta (Vectored Thrust Suite)

## New and upgraded gear

Elite Arsenal includes upgraded variants of nearly all the weapons and gear in Expanded Arsenal. It also includes +++ upgrades of the vanilla PPC, ER PPC, and Gauss rifle, which are fan favourites from tabletop.

Elite Arsenal introduces the following new defensive items. These are to offset the high damage output of weapons in EA, so that elite mechs don't routinely one-shot each other. All X- and S-tier elite mechs mount one of these items, with S-tier mechs mounting upgraded + variants.

- Passive Defensive Matrix: 20% damage reduction, +35% stability, 0 tons, 4 slots
- Hybrid Defensive Package: 20% damage reduction, +40% stability, 0.5 tons, 2 slots
- Heavy Defensive Suite: 25% damage reduction, +45% stability, 2 tons, 1 slot
- Short-Range EW Suite: +2 defense vs enemies within 120m; 20% melee damage reduction

The buffs from the Passive Defensive Matrix, Hybrid Defensive Package and Heavy Defensive Suite do not stack with each other: use the one that best fits within the constraints of your mech's free tonnage and slots.

## Elite contracts and flashpoints

Elite Arsenal provides two forms of elite missions: contracts and repeatable flashpoints.

Elite contracts can be recognised by a `(+)` in the name, at the contract selection screen. These feature an opfor heavy with X- and S-tier mechs, and are a significant jump in difficulty compared to base contracts. To match this, they have a 50% higher base C-bill payout -- but the _real_ reward is the opportunity to loot the items left on the battlefield.

An elite flashpoint is basically a sequence of elite contracts that see you fighting against the Word of Blake's Jihad, who have access to mechs and gear not seen elsewhere. After completing an elite flashpoint, it will become available again after 365 days. The location of the flashpoint is random, as are the biomes for each contract. There are 8 such flashpoints, with skull ratings from 3 to 4.5; completing lower-rated flashpoints will unlock higher-rated ones, as well as flashpoints in the bundled mods for LAMs and superheavies.

The repeatable elite flashpoints are relatively barebones in terms of story, dialogue and customisation; they are really "super-contracts" intended to provide a capstone experience for endgame players. By contrast, the LAM and superheavy flashpoints _do_ tell a story, with branching decision points and extensive dialogue with your shipmates and external NPCs.

## Installation and use

Elite Arsenal is an integral part of the Expanded Arsenal modpack, and will not work standalone.

It's possible to enable and disable Elite Arsenal dynamically within an existing game. Once disabled, any existing Elite Arsenal mechs you have in your inventory will continue to function, but you won't encounter any more such mechs until you re-enable the mod. If you do disable or re-enable mods, you should also delete the .modtek\Cache and .modtek\Database folders so that ModTek will rebuild its cache.
