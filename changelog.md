# Elite Arsenal 1.0.1

## Major changes

Revamped structure to mitigate the difficulty spike in the early game, as well as provide more of a challenge in the late game:

- Introduce new "elite" versions of contracts which are denoted by a `(+)` in the mission title. These are the same as regular contracts but feature an opfor heavy with S-tier and X-tier elite mechs, and have a 50% higher C-bill payout.
- Elite contracts are now the only place where you can encounter S-tier mechs (X-tier can still be met in regular missions, or bought in shops).
- Elite Forces custom lances moved into Elite Arsenal. Among other things, this means you can only encounter aces if Elite Arsenal is loaded.
  - Also modify Elite Forces so that the base lances will always include at least 2 vanilla mechs and pilots.

With these changes, Elite Forces and Elite Arsenal are now enabled by default when installing the modpack.


## Other changes

- Fix ++clan ERSL stats and tooltip. +10 damage was an error, now gives +25% crit chance over the regular and + variant.
- Fix Bane S loadout to have ++HAG/20s.
- Fix stability values for several mechs.
- Fix internal structure values for several vehicles.
