**Elite Arsenal** adds several features to build on the core Expanded Arsenal + Elite Forces gameplay:
- \+ and ++ variants of Expanded Arsenal weapons and gear. If you've outfitted all your mechs with heavy gauss rifles, ER lasers and Streak SRMs, this is the upgrade path you're looking for.
- 200 new variants of Expanded Arsenal mechs, which are deadlier and tougher than even those from Elite Forces. Some upgraded Clan mechs also have special abilities like the vanilla Marauder, Warhammer, Archer et al, because there's no reason the Inner Sphere should have all the fun.
- 46 new variants of vanilla and Expanded Arsenal vehicles.
- Elite versions of all the regular missions.
- Randomised drop locations and extra lances, courtesy of the Mission Control mod.
- Tweaks to the AI that make it more aggressive and unpredictable, taken from the Better AI mod.

Elite Arsenal mechs come in two varieties, X- and S-tier.

- X-tier mechs have more effective builds, + weapons and extra toughness compared to regular EA and vanilla mechs. They can be encountered in any mission.
- S-tier mechs have ++ weapons, even more toughness, and added heatsinking capacity; in addition, they are always piloted by ace mechwarriors from Elite Forces. They can only be found in elite missions, which feature an opfor heavy with X- and S-tier units.

It's entirely feasible for an S-tier mech to destroy an enemy mech of equivalent tonnage in a single alpha strike. On the flipside though, once you do kill one of these mechs, you get to loot all its goodies.


## Installation and use

Elite Arsenal is bundled with [Expanded Arsenal](https://github.com/hongooi73/ExpandedArsenal), and requires that mod to function. If you are updating an existing Expanded Arsenal install, you should **delete** the existing ExpandedArsenal, EliteArsenal, EliteForces and MissionControl folders under your Mods folder before installing the new version.

It's possible to enable and disable Elite Arsenal dynamically within an existing game. Once disabled, any existing Elite Arsenal mechs you have in your inventory will continue to function, but you won't encounter any more such mechs until you re-enable the mod. If you do disable or re-enable mods, it's highly recommended that you also delete the .modtek\Cache and .modtek\Database folders so that ModTek will rebuild its cache.


## New mechs

Here are the new mechs that are part of Elite Arsenal. Note that while the list is divided into Clan and Inner Sphere, the mod doesn't make any distinction between the two; indeed, the upgraded IS mechs can be just as tough as their Clan counterparts.
